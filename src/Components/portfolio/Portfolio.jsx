    desc: "I am currently working on a project  named Nurture Mental Health, a website dedicated to helping users find the right psychological therapy for their needs. In a team of four, I have facilitated collaboration to ensure successful project outcomes. My contributions include designing and implementing interactive website elements such as the footer, navbar, carousel, and services page. Additionally, I have configured the deployment environment to ensure smooth operation of the application in a production environment. The project leverages technologies like ReactJs, npm, Vite, Scss, NodeJs, Git, and Cloudinary.",

    desc: `For my Analog Clock project, I built a real-time clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock calculates the rotation of the hands based on the current time, updating smoothly every second. The design features a styled clock face with animated hands, utilizing CSS for layout and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. This project enhanced my skills in DOM manipulation and time-based animations and precise calculations for real-time applications.`,
